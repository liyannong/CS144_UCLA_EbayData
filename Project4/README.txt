This project manages HTTP requests for searching and getting an item info.

HTML files are responsible for main page and getting searching keywords and item ID.
Then, HTTP requests are forwarded to different java Servlets classes.
Finally, Servlets set needed attributes and render .JSP files as results.

Meanwhile, session traking are implemented using HttpSession.
